For simple \r\nimporting without any styling at all, you can use the simple `particle` mixin:\r\n\r\n    @include particle;\r\n    \r\nI'll warn you, it's ugly until you add some style, but adding style isn't hard.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable Variables and Mixins\r\n=============================\r\n","tagline":"Supplemental Tools for Compass","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
